# Day 1 – A Day In The Life Of

Today marks the start of my 100 day transformation. I've been a dentist for over 10 years. I don't take this for granted, but a week a go I decided I'd had enough. I couldn't make a go of it and decided it's time to put the weight down. I made a professional decision purely out of selfishness, to quite Dentistry for 100 days. In a profession that demands selflessness, I believe that selflessness is being taken for granted.

My goal?  
To wake up every day and live the life of a builder — creating smart systems, meaningful software, and combining my clinical and CS experience into something *only I* can offer.

## 🌅 My Ideal Day (A Day In The Life Of)

I wake up at sunrise.  
My smart home system greets me:  
> “Good morning Ehim. The time is 6:32am. Would you like me to run through today’s objectives?”

"Yes, computer," I reply.

In the bathroom, I step onto a scale embedded in the floor. A projector overlays a UI on the mirror showing my weight, posture, and hydration stats. I gesture through menus while brushing my teeth.  

My workstation lights up with Drinq and HistOracle milestones.  
I’m working on paid jobs too — sometimes freelance, sometimes as a clinical software consultant for a dental startup. The unique intersection of my dentistry background and dev skills makes me valuable in ways others can’t replicate.

## 💭 Reflections

This isn’t just a coding challenge — it’s a life design challenge.  
Every line of code, every tool I ship, brings me closer to the person I’m becoming.

Let's go.
